.. warning:: Porting Modules is a process of adapting module to new version. E.g. we have module for odoo 10.0 and we want to make module work in odoo 11.0

             As word *porting* is sometimes replaced to *migration*. You shall not confuse it with :doc:`Data Migration<../maintenance/data-migration>`, which sometimes is called just *migration*.


.. note:: We are happy to share our experience and hope that it will help someone to port odoo modules. We will be glad, if you share this page or recommend our team for module migration jobs:
